Hi, I'm Masum Biswas, a passionate self-taught Mobile Application developer and a worked as Pricipal Software Engineer in Bangladesh.

I am also an open-source enthusiast and maintainer. I learned a lot from the open-source community and I love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
